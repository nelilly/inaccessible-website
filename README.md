# inaccessible-website
The [inaccessible website](https://nelilly.github.io/inaccessible-website/) is a playground to help designers and developers understand how to test for and remediate potential accessibility issues.

It's primarily intended to be used with the [a11y-manual-testing](https://github.com/nelilly/a11y-manual-testing) and [a11y-workflow](https://github.com/nelilly/a11y-workflow) repositories.

I discovered that once you know good design accessibility design principles, it's very hard to make a bad website.

## Issues Found in Design
- Background and foreground colors must have a sufficient contrast ratio.

## Issues Found in Automated Testing 
- `:focus` styles are turned off.
- Many `img` elements are missing `alt` attribbutes.
- Many `input` elements do not have associated labels.
- In the carousel and gallery, links do not have discernible text.
- Headlines in the `header` are out of order (h3 follows h1).
- Search form submit button does not contain discernible text.
- Font sizes in the footer are too small.

## Issues Found in Manual Testing
- When the navigation opens the user is not directed to that content.
- The navigation close button contains `Ã—` as text. This will read as "times" in most screen readers.
- In VoiceOver/Safari/iOS the `h1` requires an `id="skip"` and `tabindex="-1"` to be programmatically focused on from the skip nav using JS. 
- In VoiceOver/Safari/iOS there is a text node that reads "opens in a new window" below the Contact form.
