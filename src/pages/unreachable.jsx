          <p>Character is what you are in the dark, according to Dwight L. Moody. If you&rsquo;ve ever been on a nighttime hike you may know what he means. The solitude; the quiet; the sublime feeling of the evening air. Being just another wanderer, staring into the night sky. And as we stare into the night sky, and we find ourselves.</p>

            Is the whole of life visible to us? Why shouldn&rsquo;t shining dots of the sky be as accessible as the black dots on the map of France? Just as we take the train to get to Ruoen, we take death to reach a star. Are we not entitled to hope that there may possibly be other and better conditions for painting than here on Earth?

The gaslight is yellow, and its reflections are red gold and go right down to green bronze. Against the green-blue field of the sky the Great Bear has a green and pink sparkle whose discreet paleness contrasts with the harsh gold of the gaslight. Two small coloured figures of lovers in the foreground. */}

And without my expatiating on this theme it is obvious that putting little white dots on the blue&#8209;black is not enough to paint a starry sky. */}

        <section className="section">
          <p>Vincent van Gogh became one of the most famous and influential figures in the post-impressionist movement and in the history of Western art. In the last decade of his life, he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of which date from his final two years. His artwork was characterised by bold colours and dramatic, impulsive and expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art. Much of his life and thougths were well documented &mdash; in his art; in his journals; in his letters to his brother Theo.</p>
